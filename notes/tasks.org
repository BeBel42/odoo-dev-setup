Put on context when clicking on "Goals" from employee the employee id, if directly click on "Goals" then leave the employee field empty.

Chatter seems to be mail_message.py
OR mail_thread.py (hr_version inherits it)
Adding =tracking=True= in a python field makes the chatter send a message each time it is modified

in 18.3, the summary changes are in [[project:enterprise/hr_contract_salary/controllers/main.py::849]]
In the same file, the function is used. But I can't find a way to get the same logging as in the picture

The diff message is in send_diff_email:
[[project:enterprise/hr_contract_salary/controllers/main.py::899]]
To get it, you have to sign a new _offer_ in the Recruitment app.
I did it with Billy Kyle

Xavier (xbo) connait les trucs sur les tracking values (groups specifiques + perms, etc.)

WIP on branch *master-hr_contract_salary-add_diff_message_on_employee-mlef*

** FIXME recent PRs made changes on code I am supposed to delete
[[project:enterprise/hr_contract_salary/controllers/main.py::683][enterprise/hr_contract_salary/controllers/main.py::683]]

** talk with xavier (xbo)
Try to replace [[project:enterprise/hr_contract_salary/controllers/main.py::714]]
By =employee.create_version()=
[[project:community/addons/hr/models/hr_employee.py::383]]
Vals (in theory) are the same as the one passed in old code.

After that, with the small [[https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/222744/files#diff-1c37517a76b393d1d30c2b03e96611643a747d12c13b086653989f4068c660b2R447-R450][pr he sent]] tracking values should take care of it. Maybe git pull to get the changes.

After that, delete the old diff message you made

+18.0+ *master*
=master-l10n_in_hr_payroll-minimum_wage_check-mlef=
PR:
https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/pull/35602

File:
l10n_in_hr_payroll/data/hr_rule_parameters_data.xml

Hint:
https://github.com/odoo/enterprise/pull/35602#discussion_r1119774480

Rule (Basic Salary, India: Regular Pay):
=result = max(payslip._rule_parameter('l10n_in_basic_value'), payslip.paid_amount * payslip._rule_parameter('l10n_in_basic_percent') * payslip._rule_parameter('l10n_in_basic_days'))=
Since payslip.paid_amout is 0, it thus does =max(700, 0)=

- empecher MONTHLY wage to be under the value
- et retirer max dans rule
- wage_hourly = hourly wage
- wage = monthly wage
- on master and not 18.0

** [X]
should I continue with what I was doing? Like the check, migration, etc.?
If so, the hourly_wage needs to be converted to a monthly wage to be checked against l10n_in_basic_value (?)
-> Update: it has been CANCELLED

** Talk with David PO
***  Should ask suga for minimum wage (the monthly, the hourly and the fixed one) and use those values instead
***  The constraint will have to be applied to all wage types. Not just monthly
***  Do not add case at right of payroll tab
***  Remove "From l10n_basic_value" from ui error message
***  The test will have to be changed accordingly
***  Migrate it all to 19.0 (19.1?)

hr_employee
pour leave types qui demandent pas allocations & qui sont coches sur "deduct extra hours", dans _get_consumed_leaves(), je dois rajouter dans var envoyee sur discord, mais False au lieu de [allocation] (False c'est l'allocation qui n'en es pas une)

=allocations_leaves_consumed[<employee>][<holiday_status>][False]=

Je dois faire le allocations_data.update({}) mais dans false

*Extra stuff to do*
Time off type > Si coche / decoche requires allocation, alors decoche / coche hide on dashboard
Idem pour deduct extra hours
- Do a computed property, stored readonly=false so that it change (and can still be changed by user) the checkbox

** Review SUGA - May 12, 2025:
38:00 / week = 7:36 hours a day
So 10:00 = 10:00 - 7:36 = 2:24 hours of overtime

On a 40h / week contract, extra hours seems legit
*DO NOT* drop the DB! I have done tests.

*The contract does not change anything.*
It's just the *working hours* under _Employee/WorkInfo/Schedule/Working Hours_
