#+title: Odoo dev setup

* Project setup
- First setup the project (cloning may take some time)
  You'll need to do this only once.
#+begin_src sh
./setup
#+end_src

- Once everything is set up, you can start Odoo using the =utility script=
#+begin_src sh
./run # internally calls docker-compose
#+end_src
Done.
Odoo now runs on =localhost:8069=

* Utility script
- When needing to restart the odoo server /e.g.: after some changes/, just restart odoo using the *utility script*:
#+begin_src sh
./run -m <module_name> # reload module
#+end_src
There is no need to manually shut down the docker container. The utility script will take care of that.
** Script details
To get more information about the =run= script, do:
#+BEGIN_SRC
./run --help
#+END_SRC
