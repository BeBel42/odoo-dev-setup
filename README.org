#+title: Odoo dev setup

- First setup the project (cloning may take some time)
  You'll need to do this only once.
#+begin_src sh
bash ./setup.bash
#+end_src

- Once everything is set up, you can start Odoo
#+begin_src sh
docker compose up
#+end_src
Done.
Odoo now runs on =localhost:8069=

- When needing to restart the odoo server /e.g.: after some changes/, just restart the odoo container:
#+begin_src sh
docker compose restart odoo
# restarting all the containers works fine too
docker compose restart
#+end_src
